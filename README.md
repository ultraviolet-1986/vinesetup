# vinesetup
A BASH script to help users set up and maintain a new Vine Linux installation.

**Vine Linux Homepage:** http://vinelinux.org/

**Build Environment:** Linux Mint 17.2 KDE amd64, Sublime Text 3

**Notes:**
- This is an update of an old command-line project, and it is a work in progress.

**To do:**
- Add in an 'offline' menu as well as the default 'online' version, and remove the Main Menu text regarding Internet connection availability.
- Add better desktop detection to determine what desktop is being used. This can be accessed by viewing the $DESKTOP_SESSION variable.
- Optimise all root commands to call sudo *only* when required to increase security.

**Change Log:**
- **18/08/2015**

	- Updated 'README.md'.
